# Overview
This project tests my DependencyGraph project, tests without a category are more general tests ensuring that the graph is working correctly.
Test with a Error Handling category are for edge cases or bad actors. 

# Comments to evaluator
I tried to standardize my test titles by putting test at the end, and using similar names (using a null/using a present or absent value)
Currently, my line coverage of my DependencyGraph is 100%.
