# Overview
This project is a library infix calculator that can handle all basic arithmetic operations as well as identify variables given a delegate. Since this is a library,
I wrote a testing program that tests all operations as well as edge cases and error handling in the FormulaEvaluatorTester project. My calculator is capable of:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It follows correct orders of operation, and it recognizes when a incorrect formula is passed by throwing
an argument exception.
